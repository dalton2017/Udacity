## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## GameDetails

-This is the classic matching game in which you try to match pictures within the cards.

-You have 16 cards and 3 stars as a starter .... number of stars represents your performance.

-Stars fall of once at a time (Minimum of 1 star left) according to this criteria:
    - At 18 moves mark first star will disaappear.
    - At 24 moves mark second star will disappear.

-Long story short ... the more moves you do the lower is your performance.

-You can restart the game using the restart button at top right of the screen.

-When you are done .. you get a popup message stating your time, number of stars and number of moves   you did, if you want to play again press "PLAY AGAIN" button, and if you don`t want to continue       just press "close" button.

## Dependencies

-Works With Chrome's and Mozilla's latest versions according to tests.

## Notes
